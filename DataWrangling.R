# dplyr is a grammar of data manipulation, providing a consistent set of verbs that help you solve the most common data manipulation challenges:
#   
# mutate() adds new variables that are functions of existing variables
# select() picks variables based on their names.
# filter() picks cases based on their values.
# summarise() reduces multiple values down to a single summary.
# arrange() changes the ordering of the rows.
